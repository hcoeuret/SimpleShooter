# SimpleShooter - 3D third person shooter

This game was made to challenge myself with advanced concept in AI, UI and animation in Unreal Engine. 

## Setup 

Clone the repo and launch it through the unreal editor. You can also generate the exe file and play it directly on your computer

## The game

In this game, you control a 3rd person futuristic soldier, deployed to clear an ennemy base of its occupants. You move with the arrow key and shoot with the left mouse button. You will have to kill all enemies scattered around the base to win. Beware as they will follow and shoot you on sight.

Good luck and have fun !
